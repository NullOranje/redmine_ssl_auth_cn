= Redmine SSL auth plugin

This redmine plugin enables authentication using SSL client certificates

== Notes 

* This plugin expects the CN of the certificate to be an email address
* A user with that email address should exist in the database
* This doesn't check any password, so implement certificate verification in Apache
* You can visit /login?skip_ssl=1 to skip SSL authentication and do regular login
