= Redmine SSL auth plugin

This redmine plugin enables authentication using SSL client certificates

== Usage

It's very simple

* Install the plugin: ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/koke/redmine_ssl_auth.git
* Configure apache for SSL authentication (see Configuration)
* Visit https://YOURSITE/login and it will login automatically

== Notes 

* This plugin expects the CN of the certificate to be your username 
* A user with that username should exist in the database
* This doesn't check any password, so implement certificate verification in Apache
* You can visit /login?skip_ssl=1 to skip SSL authentication and do regular login

== Configuration

Nice tutorial: http://www.vanemery.com/Linux/Apache/apache-SSL.html

This is not up to date, I will update later.... (Steve)

In my case, I find this to be the configuration I wanted

        SSLEngine on
        SSLProtocol all 
        SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM

        SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.crt
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.key
        SSLCACertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/ca.crt

        SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" \
                nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
                downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0

        SSLVerifyClient optional
        SSLVerifyDepth 1
        SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
        SSLOptions +FakeBasicAuth
        
        <Location /login/ssl>
          SSLVerifyClient require
        </Location>

        <Location />
           AuthName "eBox HQ"
           AuthType Basic
           AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/passwd/team
           #Require valid-user
        </Location>

By making <tt>SSLVerifyClient optional</tt> and commenting <tt>Require valid-user</tt>, it's possible to login without a certificate, using the regular login/password. A link is shown in the login form to require SSL authentication, see the <tt>Location /login/ssl</tt> section in the apache configuration.

If you want to force your users to use certificates, change SSLVerifyClient to require and uncomment <tt>Require valid-user</tt>

To jbernal@ebox-platform.com

Please, don't ask about apache configuration. I don't know much more than it's already here. Email about the plugin (bugs, patches, suggestions, ...) is welcome :)
